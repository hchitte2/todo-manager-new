# Todo Manager — Express + React

Full-stack todo list app with JWT auth, built with Express/TypeScript (backend) and React/Vite (frontend).

---

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Backend | Express, TypeScript, SQLite, JWT |
| Frontend | React, Vite, TypeScript |
| Testing | Jest, Supertest, Vitest, Playwright |

---

## New Features Added

### Backend
- **Toggle todo completion** — `PATCH /lists/:id/todos/:todoId` flips a todo between complete/incomplete
- **Delete todo** — `DELETE /lists/:id/todos/:todoId`
- **Delete list** — `DELETE /lists/:id` (cascades to all todos)
- **User-scoped lists** — lists now have a `user_id` column; each user only sees their own lists
- **CORS** — added `PATCH` and `DELETE` to allowed methods
- **Token expiry** — extended access token from 30s → 1h for usability

### Frontend UI/UX
- **Two-column layout** — auth sidebar stays fixed; workspace expands on login
- **Todo completion checkbox** — check a todo to mark it done with strikethrough
- **Delete buttons (×)** — per todo and per list card
- **Color-coded status banner** — green for success, red for errors
- **Progress bars** — global (sidebar) and per-list showing completed/total
- **User avatar** — shows first initial of logged-in email
- **Responsive grid** — list cards flow into columns on wide screens
- **Empty state** — placeholder when no lists exist

## Running the App

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install

# Terminal 1 — backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 — frontend
npm run dev:frontend
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit + integration tests (backend + frontend)
npm test

# E2E tests — stop servers first, Playwright manages its own
kill $(lsof -ti :3002) 2>/dev/null
kill $(lsof -ti :5173) 2>/dev/null
npm run test:e2e
```
